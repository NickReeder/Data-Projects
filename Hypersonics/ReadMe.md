### Project Description

This is the research report from my summer working with William & Mary's Dr. Hunt and my research partner Ben Kim (UVA). Our primary focus was in performing an Uncertainty Analysis on
a Hypersonic (MACH 5 and above) vehicle's Thermal Protection System (TPS). My side of the project focues on first developing a surrogate model through various statisticsal models, primarily
Random Forest Regression (RFR) and Lasso Regression. Ben focused on using Gaussian Process Regression to develop his surrogate.

The project also involved mentoring a group of highschool students, tutoring them in both programming and data science.

Thanks and acknowledgements to Dr. Hunt for his phenominal mentorship, Dr. Sasinowska for the opportunity, and Ben Kim for being a great research partner.
